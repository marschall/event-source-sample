Event Source Example
====================
A small example on how to use (EventSource)[http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/] aka Server-Sent Events with Java/Jetty.

You need jetty-project/jetty-eventsource-servlet then go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/event-source-sample/ and you see the server time that gets updated all ten seconds. Not very useful but shows you how to use the API.
